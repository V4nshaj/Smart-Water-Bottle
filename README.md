Aqua-Trail: IOT Based Smart Water Bottle

AquaTrail's IoT-enabled smart water bottle advances health and technology. This innovative design, incorporating ESP8266 for faster, long-range Wi-Fi data transmission, promotes hydration and healthier habits. 
A companion app is created that connects the smart water bottle to users. After registering and logging in, the app retrieves this data to display water intake and remaining amount.
